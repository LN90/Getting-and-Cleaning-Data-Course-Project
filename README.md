# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The final assignment for the Coursera Course.

The run_analysis.R script does the following:
Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurments on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurment.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activity in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with the descriptive variable names.
From the data set that was created, an independ tidy data set with the avarage of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.
